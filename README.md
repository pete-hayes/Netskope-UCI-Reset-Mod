# Netskope UCI Reset Mod
A Tampermonkey userscript that adds a **Reset UCI Score** link beside the active user in the dashboard for Netskope Advanced Behavior Analytics. Clicking the link triggers the Netskope UCI (User Confidence Index) reset API for the selected user, and a small colored dot shows success or failure.

## Features
- Adds a **Reset UCI Score** link next to each user
- A circle indicator reflects the UCI reset status:
  - ðŸŸ  Request in progress  
  - ðŸŸ¢ Success  
  - ðŸ”´ Failure  
  - âšª Idle or after switching to a new user  
- Debug logging in the browser console
